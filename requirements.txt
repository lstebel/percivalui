# Oddly cython *is* actually a dependency, however due to some
# obscure 'pip' bug, sub-dependencies are not installed in the
# correct order when explicitly listed. It *will* however be
# installed automatically and correctly when h5py is installed.
# Pip bug report here: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2478
# and the equivalent h5py bug report: https://github.com/h5py/h5py/issues/535
